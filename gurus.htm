          was chela (disciple) of the legendary <font color="#FFCC00"><strong>GURU 
          SHAMBHU MAHARAJ</strong></font>. She has taken up the challenge of extending 
          and enlarging the classical repertoire to include subjects relevant 
          to a contemporary context and revolutionised the traditional world of 
          <font color="#FFCC00"> <strong>KATHAK</strong></font> with her unique 
          development of modern group- and solo choreographies. For her, the classics 
          will always be a source of inspiration and instruction, however, experiment 
          and innovation are essential to the survival of a tradition.<br>
          Kumudini feels the necessity to enrich and refine traditional arts with 
          present day energy, to demystify indian dance forms for the benefit 
          of a deeper understanding of their content.<br>
          Her innovative creations are artistic experiments, utilizing the rich 
          potential of classical Indian dance principles to explore spacial and 
          dynamical possibilities and to express themes with social relevance 
          in a contemporary context. Her dance centre <font color="#FFCC00"><strong>'KADAMB' 
          </strong></font>in Ahmedabad embodies todays spirit of dance in India 
          and has, with its discovery of new dimensions, found worldwide recognition 
          and admiration.</font></font> </div>
