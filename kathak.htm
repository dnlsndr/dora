        Actually, in the beginning was the Dance, the Rhythm of the Universe, 
        which begann with creation. But, because the story of creation had to 
        be retold and its variegated, complex and subtle phenomena interpreted 
        through the stories of the gods and godesses, heroes and heroines, the 
        dance-word became necessary. <br>
        <br>
        Kathak is the adumbration of these stories, and Kathak is the person who 
        tells them. This is the ancient Hindu theory, of the origin of the dance 
        style, which came to be known as Kathak.<br>
        <br>
        Formed by the manifold influences of social, religious and political developements 
        in Northern India, it originally was a dance imbued with the Vaishnava-Philosophy 
        and Krishna-Theme. During the reign of the Moghul princes it underwent 
        a renaissance and flowered, secularized, enriched and refined, into the 
        favourite entertainment at the courts. Hence, in this sophisticated dance 
        form, hinduistic and islamic components unify and culminate into a presentation, 
        the elegance, rhythmical virtuosity and energetic brilliancy of which 
        bears witness to the cultural wealth of Northern India.</font></strong></div>
