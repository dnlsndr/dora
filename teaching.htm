      following the principles of the dance training one learns to understand 
      the enormous resources of the body; its energy, power and self esteem.<br>
      <br>
      The dynamic principles of line, centre, balance and flow are as significant 
      for the dance as they are for life.<br>
      <br>
      These principles are breaking down if dance forms are limited to verbal, 
      interpretative and spiritualized contents only.<br>
      <br>
      The body in our times is endangered of beeing reduced to its functions as 
      a commodity only &#8211; to work, to satisfy and be satisfied. <br>
      <br>
      Beeing therefore more and more desensualized, fragmentized and alienated, 
      it has turned to a mere cosmetic appendage, deprived of its inherent qualities 
      of integration, action, dignity <br>
      and struggle.</font></td>

        all the classical dance forms of the subcontinent, Indias ancient culture 
        is expressed: <br>
        the principle to see the body as the centre of the world and to connect 
        it with the society, <br>
        the community, the environment and the cosmos. <br>
        The dancer with her extraordinarily manifold means of expression describes 
        the stories as well as impersonates the varied characters of the mythology 
        of India. However, above and superior of all expressions,<strong> <font color="#FFCC00">RHYTHM 
        </font></strong>is acknowledged as an universal and abstract principle 
        of the highest and supreme order. Hence, the elements of mime, gesture, 
        movement, speech, emotions and intellect are its basic accessories and 
        under its service.</font></div></td>
